I'm currently in college (Freshman year) to get my bachelor's degree in Computer Science. 

I know some Java, a tiny bit of HTML, and plan to learn other languages as well while I solidify my current knowledge of the two languages.

I have a large interest in possibly getting a job in programming video games for console systems in my future.
